            <h1>Work experience</h1>
            <p> Nearly two decades in the culinary industry has brought me into some of the most dynamic and exciting kitchens Canada has to offer. From Alberta all the way to Nova Scotia I have been honing my craft and learning every facet of the kitchen industry. Along the way I have picked up many habits and skills that lend themselves well to working in IT/web development. Being organized and able to streamline work flow, Working under constant deadlines with a sense of urgency and the ability to juggle many moving parts at once are just some examples of the essential qualities my career in kitchens has instilled in me. I am eager for the opportunity to apply those skills in a new field and excited at where they will continue to take me. Listed here are a few of the highlights of my last eighteen years.</p>

            <h3> Department of National Defense. 2019-2023</h3>
            <p>I spent four years within a civilian capacity, employed by the DND at CFB Halifax. There I worked with a mixed team of civilian and Navy members to ensure all the proper nutritional needs of military members stationed in our building were met. From meal planning and prep to the final cooking and serving of the meals, our team served up an entire buffet three times daily.</p>
            <p>Another fulfilling aspect of my position with the DND was making sure new recruits received the proper training they needed to succeed in the culinary trade. We had a constant cycle of new cooks at various stages in their education that we got to work alongside to ensure they had the skills needed to keep our Navy fed on boats and bases all across Canada once they were fully certified in their trade.</p>
